``odeint (module Solver) f y0 timespec ()`` numerically integrates
an initial value problem for a system of ODEs given an initial value:

.. math::
  \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y,t)

.. math::
  y(t_{0}) = y_{0}

Here :math:`t` is a one-dimensional independent variable (time), :math:`y(t)` is an
n-dimensional vector-valued function (state), and the n-dimensional
vector-valued function :math:`f(y, t)` determines the differential equations.

The goal is to find :math:`y(t)` approximately satisfying the differential
equations, given an initial value :math:`y(t_{0}) = y_{0}`.
The time :math:`t_{0}` is passed as part of the timespec, that includes
also the final integration time and a time step. Refer to
{!Owl_ode.Types.tspec_t} for further information.

The solver has to be passed as a first-class module and have a common
type, {!Owl_ode.Types.SolverT}. This is useful to write new custom
solvers or extend and customise the provided ones.

Refer to the documentation of the {!Owl_ode.Types.SolverT} type
for further information.
